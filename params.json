{"name":"Omid","body":"Omid\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis project provides transactional support for HBase (or any other key-value store) using Snapshot Isolation.\r\nIf you have any question, please contact us at omid-project@googlegroups.com\r\n\r\nArchitecture\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOmid is composed by a server (the Status Oracle) and several clients. The server contains all the information\r\nneeded to manage transactions and replicates it to the clients which just contact the server when they want\r\nto start a transaction or commit it.\r\n\r\nThe server uses BookKeeper as a Writer Ahead Log where it dumps all its state. In case of crash it is possible\r\nto restart the server without losing any commit information.\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nOmid uses Maven for its build system. We are using a temporary repository for zookeeper and bookkeeper packages to ease\r\nthe installation procedure\r\n\r\nThen to compile omid:\r\n\r\n    $ tar jxvf omid-1.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.bz2\r\n    $ cd omid-1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n    $ mvn install\r\n\r\nTests should run cleanly.\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\n\r\nYou need to run four components before running the transactional\r\nclient. They are bookkeeper, zookeeper, omid tso and\r\nhbase. Bookkeeper is needed by the TSO. Zookeeper is needed by\r\nbookkeeper and hbase. The TSO is needed by hbase. Hence, the order of\r\nstarting should be: \r\n\t 1. Zookeeper\r\n\t 2. Bookkeeper\r\n\t 3. TSO\r\n\t 4. Hbase\r\n\r\n### Zookeeper & Bookkeeper\r\nFor simplicity we've included a utility script which starts zookeeper\r\nand bookkeeper. Run:\r\n\r\n    $ bin/omid.sh bktest\r\n\r\nOmid doesn't use anything special in zookeeper or bookkeeper, so you\r\ncan use any install for these. However, if you are running this\r\nanywhere but localhost, you need to update the setting for hbase and \r\nTSO. See the hbase docs for changing the zookeeper quorum. For TSO,\r\nyou need to modify bin/omid.sh.\r\n\r\n### TSO\r\nTo start the TSO, run:\r\n   \r\n    $ bin/omid.sh tso\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\nTo benchmark the TSO alone, run:\r\n\r\n    $ bin/omid.sh tsobench\r\n\r\n### HBase\r\nWe've included a utility script to start a HBase cluster on your local\r\nmachine. Run:\r\n\r\n    $ bin/omid.sh tran-hbase\r\n\r\nFor running in a cluster\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe public api is in\r\n\r\n    src/main/java/com/yahoo/omid/client/TransactionalTable.java\r\n    src/main/java/com/yahoo/omid/client/TransactionState.java\r\n    src/main/java/com/yahoo/omid/client/TransactionManager.java\r\n\r\nFor an example of usage, look in\r\n\r\n    src/test/java/com/yahoo/omid/TestBasicTransaction.java\r\n\r\nLogging \r\n-------\r\nLogging can be adjusted in src/main/resource/log4j.properties.\r\n","tagline":"Transactional Support for HBase","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
